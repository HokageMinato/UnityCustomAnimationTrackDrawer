Usecases:
Set FrameData array to display custom timelines and highlights using FrameEvents.
(Im using debug inspector to showcase the features but setting values in FrameData property works easily)

- Flexible layout ensuring maxium accessibility.
- Easily traverse, zoom the track for overall evaluation. 
- At present it is boilerplate code but can be easily extended as per requirements.
